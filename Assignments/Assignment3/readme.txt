Project: A Complex Number Calculator 
  This program calculates the addition, subtraction,multiplication and division of complex number. This program is able to work in two different modes which is interactive mode and batch mode. With interactive mode you are able to type your complex you prefer to either add, subtract, multiply or divide when asked to in the format A 4 3 -7 6(input), then the program calculates the addition of the complex numbers and displays the answer. In batch mode, the program reads its input from a text file and displays its output and also writes the output into an output file. 
  This program displays an error when the wrong functions (A,D,S,M) is written as an input and is able to accept small letters of these functions(a,d,s,m). If a multiple inputs are put in while the program is running it would run in a continuous loop. type in 'ctrl c' to end the program and run it again. 
  New additions have been added to the complex number calculator. This new program as well as making simple calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division also calculates the absolute magnitude, the angle in radians, the angle in degrees, the exponential and the inverse of the given complex numbers with the commands abs(absolute), arg(angle in radians), the argDeg(angle in degrees), exp(exponent) and inv(inverse). With these new commands, this program would still be able to collect inputs from either batch file or through interactive mode.
